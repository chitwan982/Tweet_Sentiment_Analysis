NLP_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using machine learning techniques. The implemented system includes a data preprocessing pipeline that involves noise reduction, stemming, and lemmatization using the nltk library. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has been performed, featuring visualizations such as WordClouds and top emotion words. The sentiment analysis models, based on Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, achieved an impressive accuracy of 93%. The goal is to understand and categorize the sentiment expressed in tweets, offering valuable insights for applications in social media monitoring and opinion analysis.

The hands on project on Twitter Sentiment Analysis is divided into following tasks:

Task #1: Understand the Problem Statement and business case

Task #2: Import libraries and datasets

Task #3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

Task #4: Plot the word cloud

Task #5: Perform data cleaning - removing punctuation

Task #6: Perform data cleaning - remove stop words

Task #7: Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization)

Task #8: Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization

Task #9: Understand the theory and intuition behind Naive Bayes classifiers

Task #10: Train a Naive Bayes Classifier

Task #11: Assess trained model performance
